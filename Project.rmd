## Introduction

## Research Objectives

## Data Collection


## EDA
-using EDA to make decisions about the data : remove outliers, taking log of resale prices , removing certain categorical columns 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)

housing <- read.csv("Resale_Price_2017_2022.csv")

id <- sample(nrow(housing),5000)
sample_housing <- housing[id,]
## histogram
ggplot(sample_housing) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=floor_area_sqm,y=resale_price),size=0.3) + 
  theme_minimal()
ggplot(sample_housing) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=floor_area_sqm,y=log(resale_price)),size=0.3) + 
  theme_minimal()

```
We do a sample of 5000 on the original dataset, to argue that the increase of a small amount of floor area(sqm) doesn't result it a linear amount of resale price being added, but instead some non-linear increase in the price. This is equivalent to adding to a log of the resale prices. So we conclude that it results in better prediction if we do a regression on the log(resale price).

## Model Training and Evaluation

## Limitation and Future Work
